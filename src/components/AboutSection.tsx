At Millburn High School (GPA 4.322; ACT 36), learning is a daily habit, from AP CS and Physics to leading clarinet in state and regional ensembles, where disciplined practice meets creative problem‑solving. Aspiring computer scientist and innovator with experience in AI, web development, and automation, committed to building technologies that connect people and make the world smarter and kinder

Coaching youth tennis and volunteering at Turtle Back Zoo deepen patience, clear communication, and a respect for how people learn differently—principles carried into every project brief and code review. The goal is always the same: listen first, build second, iterate until it serves real needs with clarity and reliability.                </p>

                  <span className="highlight font-semibold">Learning is the throughline—</span>Columbia SHP coursework in advanced computing, hands‑on builds with Python/React/cloud basics, and client websites that turn constraints into clean, scalable solutions. Recent work includes AI tools and workflow automations for small businesses, with write‑ups that show decisions, metrics, and reflections rather than just results. If admitted, that same curiosity, care, and momentum will strengthen communities on campus—through human‑centered engineering, music, and mentorship that make technology more inclusive in practice, not just in promise.
